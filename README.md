# anxiety-generator
A python port of Paul Ford's 'anxietyBox' (https://github.com/ftrain/anxietybox).

Usage:
./anxietyGenerator [anxiety [ anxiety ... ] ]

If you supply zero or more anxieties (which should be verb-phrases like "write an OS" or "port anxietybox to python"), it will choose from that list at random while running, criticizing your goals in a cruel and passive-aggressive way.

If you do not supply any anxieties, it will choose one at random from a randomized and truncated set of phrases originally from an oblique strategies deck.

Once you initiate the program, it goes into an interactive session -- like a mean, snarky chatbot. To exit the interactive mode and run away from your feelings, hit 'return' and submit an empty line, or press control-D.
